# CodingEveryday
i'm a beginner in python ï¼Œthe repository is recorded my learning in python and date analysis. 
I hope i could code a lot program,so I create this to help myself to keep discipline.
I graduated from a Chinese university with a bachelor's degree and worked in a Chinese software company for a year and a half.
Now i'am in Japan,I'am learning Japanese and looking for a job in a Japanese company.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's very hard to say my road.
I love sports and in China I can't find any job in sports area. because i dont have a degree about sports and i also dont a pro athlete.
so i think in Asia , Japan have the best Sports Resoures and i can pay that,that's why i choose to go to Japan.
But after coming to Japan,my thinking was completely subverted. As foreigners we need to pay higher tuition fees and less scholarships.
Japan has the same strict examination system as China. I hate that, Since i was young. 
I want to leran by doing something,doing project.not just school. now i'am learning japanese in a japanese language school. as the same,everyday you need 
to pass the test, if you dont pass the test, you will not learn in next higer level class. They teach with traditional,boring ways, using textbook and 
teaching grammer,remember words.   but i through Reading japanese books and Listening japanese TV drama,manga,shows to learn japanese. 
One of the funny things is That when i take the conversation exam, i have to use the corresponding grammar to speak. the answer is only one.

I like learn something through my ownway.
now I want to relearn technology, I want to learn how to use some tools to bulid the new world. coding maybe is a one way, so I will keep learn that
and keep Reading books. 
I think what matters is what i create. not what l learn. By creating something new at the same time, learning knowledge. i think is the way i like.
